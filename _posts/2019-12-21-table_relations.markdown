    Table Relations allow data to flow. By having a good flow in your data, it allows you to understand and retrieve data. If you are in a scenario where you have thousand or even millions of data hving table relations will help you pinpoint the data you want. There is different types of relations. The first relation is a one to many relationship. A specific data like a client can have more than one data attached to it. The second type is a many to many relationship. In this type of data you consider both sides of the party. For example, a person can own different types of cars, and a car can have different types of owners. Both sides can have different IDs attached to them. Tha last type of relation is a one to one relstionship. This type of relation is hard to come across. This is when data is attached to only one source of data. Being able to store data and have it to where different tables of data relate to each other, which allows you to get the exact information you want.
