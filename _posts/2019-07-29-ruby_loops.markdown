  What is Looping in coding? It is when you tell a program to repeat something over and over again. In order to solve a looping lab you first have to if your program wants you to make an unlimited or a certain amount of loops. You start by typing**loop**  and then **do** and you would need to write **end** . In between do and end you can write **puts " ",** the loop simply tells whatever is between do and end to execute and start the looping process. To stop the loop you press **ctrl and c.** If the lab wants you to loop a certain amount of times you would need to use **break** in the code. You use **counter** and set it equal to 0 or what the lab tells you before ** loop** . You then tell it to do increments of 1 or what the lab tell you by using **counter = counter + 1 or counter += 1** inside the do before puts. You will have to use an if counter argument and the use break and end.

  Another way to loop is by using times but it has to be accompanied by an inter for example **3.times do**. You don't write loop in this method. What you put in bewtween **do and end** is what it will be repeating until the criteria is met. Of course you have to use **puts " "** and what the lab wants you to repeat. 
	
	Then you have a different method where you use **while** or **until**. With this method you dont have to use an if argument. With while you can use it to keep repeating while a condition is met. With until you can use use it until a condition is met. You set your counter and the increments you want it to go by as stated above in the first paragraph. You don't have to write do in this method, but remember to always end it.
